I made this bot with the plan of bring every course task, calendar, info and more to our most used and intuitive platform, Discord. 
Post everything using simple slash commands and store it on a Sqlite database, every content that you post is linked with your GuildID (server id),
so everyone will get only the info linked with your server, allowing the use of this bot on different servers. 

* The best result of sophistication is based on simplicity
